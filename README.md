Creating your own website is an exciting and rewarding journey, especially if you’re just starting with web development.

It’s a great way to dive into HTML and CSS while unleashing your creativity and building a solid portfolio piece.

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through creating a stylish, coffee-themed website using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The site will feature key sections like Home, About, Menu, Testimonials, Gallery, Contact, and a Footer.

One of the best parts? The website will be fully responsive, ensuring it looks amazing on both mobile devices and desktops.

For the Testimonials section, we’ll include a slider to showcase customer reviews in a dynamic, eye-catching way. 

It’s a fun and interactive feature that gives visitors more reasons to fall in love with your coffee shop. 

On mobile, we’ll include a sleek hamburger menu in the header to simplify navigation.
